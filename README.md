# Angular Appointment Scheduler

This project is a simple and intuitive appointment scheduler built using Angular. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage appointments, allowing users to easily create, view, update, and delete appointments within a calendar view.  This project serves as a practical example of building a front-end application with Angular and demonstrates core concepts like component-based architecture, reactive forms, and data handling (potentially mocked or requiring backend integration).

## Features

* **Intuitive Calendar View:**  Displays appointments in a clear and easy-to-navigate calendar format (likely day, week, or month view).
* **Create Appointments:**  Allows users to create new appointments with details such as:
    * Title/Subject
    * Date and Time (start and end)
    * Description/Notes
* **View Appointments:** Easily view all scheduled appointments within the calendar.
* **Update Appointments:**  Provides functionality to modify existing appointment details.
* **Delete Appointments:**  Allows users to remove appointments from the schedule.
* **Responsive Design (Likely):**  Designed to be usable on various screen sizes (though specific responsiveness may vary).
* **Angular Based:** Built using the Angular framework, showcasing best practices in Angular development.
* **Learning Resource:**  A great project for learning Angular and understanding how to build a basic scheduling application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Angular Appointment Scheduler running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js** (version 16 or higher recommended) - [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
* **npm** (Node Package Manager - usually comes with Node.js) or **yarn** [https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* **Angular CLI** (Angular Command Line Interface) - Install globally using: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Michael-ctrl-eng/Angular-Appointment-Scheduler.git
Use code with caution.
Markdown
Navigate to the project directory:

cd Angular-Appointment-Scheduler
Use code with caution.
Bash
Install dependencies:

npm install  # or yarn install
Use code with caution.
Bash
This command will install all the necessary npm packages listed in package.json.

Running the Application
Start the development server:

ng serve
Use code with caution.
Bash
or

npm start  # Check package.json scripts for the exact start command if 'ng serve' doesn't work directly.
Use code with caution.
Bash
Open your browser: Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application should now be running in your browser.

Using the Application
Once the application is running, you should be able to:

View the Calendar: Navigate through the calendar to see appointments for different days, weeks, or months.

Create a New Appointment: Look for a button or interface element to create a new appointment (e.g., "Add Appointment," "+", or clicking on a time slot). Fill in the appointment details in the form and save.

View Appointment Details: Click on an appointment in the calendar to view its details.

Edit an Appointment: Look for an "Edit" button or option when viewing appointment details to modify the appointment.

Delete an Appointment: Look for a "Delete" button or option when viewing appointment details to remove the appointment.

Note on Data Persistence:

This project, in its current form, might be primarily a front-end demonstration. Appointment data might be stored in memory or simulated. For a persistent appointment scheduler, you would typically need to integrate a backend server and database to store and retrieve appointment data. This repository may not include backend integration.
